## Overview
Using Tableau and Pandas, an analysis of a New York City bike sharing program was conducted to investigate how a similar program could work in Des Moines, Iowa.
## Results

This heatmap shows the breakdown of trips for each day of the week and depicts how many bikes were used per hour.  The most popular days were Monday through Friday from 5pm to 7pm, the same hours when people tend to head home from work.  There is also a spike in usage Monday through Friday from 8am to 9am, when people tend to head to work.

This trio of heatmaps describes the distribution of bike trips over the week, per hour, divided into groups by gender.  Males and females share similar usage patterns, with the most popular hours being when they are heading to and from work.  

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

This chart shows the number of trips broken down between user type (customer vs. subscriber), day of the week, and gender.  The genders are similar in usage in the customer user type, with the most popular days of use being Saturday and Sunday.  The subscribers tended to use the bikes during the week.

## Summary
Based on the results of the analysis, the bike sharing program is most often utilized during the week, particularly during the hours that people are heading to and from work.  There is also a bump in usage one the weekend, particularly among the customer user type.

### Suggestions for Further Anaylsis
It would be interesting to see a visualization of the gender breakdown by user type.  Another visualization that could be completed is the average trip duration broken down by days of the week.
